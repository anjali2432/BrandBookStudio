LINEAR REGRESSION

Linear regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm that predicts a continuous target variable based on one or more independent variables.

indept feature (1) - univariable
more than one indept feature - multi variable

Simple Linear Regression
This is the simplest form of linear regression, and it involves only one independent variable and one dependent variable. The equation for simple linear regression is:
y=β0+β1X       

Multiple Linear Regression
This involves more than one independent variable and one dependent variable. The equation for multiple linear regression is:
y=β0+β1X1+β2X2+………………+βnXn 

The best Fit Line equation provides a straight line that represents the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. The slope of the line indicates how much the dependent variable changes for a unit change in the independent variable(s).
