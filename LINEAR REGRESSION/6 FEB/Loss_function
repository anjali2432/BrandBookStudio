LOSS FUNCTION:

mean square error  - used to calc the risk functio or loss function
- how close line is to a given of data points
  taking the average of square error is mse
  square error is diffrence between actual and predict value and square it

mean absolute error - same
- it find the average diffirence between actual and predict value

R squared  - measure the value of dept feature that eapalin indept feature
- find goodness of fit of a linear regression model

 r2 =1− ( Sum of Squared Residuals (SSR) / Total Sum of Squares (SST) )

​ssr - sum of square diffrence between acutal and predict
sst - sum of squre diffrence between acutal and  and mean of acutal value.

Adjusted R2 - same as r2 but we can add no of predict in the model

adj_r2 =1− ((1−R2).(n−1) / (n−k−1))

​n- no of data set point 
k- no of indept feature
