Ensemble Learning:
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training.

Random Sampling:
Each tree is trained on a random subset of the training data, chosen with replacement (bootstrap sampling).

Feature Randomization:
At each node of the tree, only a random subset of features is considered for splitting.

Building Decision Trees:
Decision trees are constructed recursively, splitting the data based on the selected features.

Voting for Classification, Averaging for Regression:
For classification, predictions are made by a majority vote of the trees.
For regression, predictions are averaged across the trees.

Robust to Overfitting:
Random Forest is less prone to overfitting compared to individual decision trees, thanks to the ensemble approach.

High Predictive Accuracy:
Random Forest often achieves high accuracy and is widely used in various domains.

Feature Importance:
Provides a measure of feature importance, indicating the contribution of each feature to the model's predictive performance.

Applications:
Used for both classification and regression tasks in areas such as finance, healthcare, and image analysis.

Scalability:
Can handle large datasets and high-dimensional feature spaces.

Parallelization:
Training of individual trees can be parallelized, making Random Forest efficient for large-scale data.

Tuning Parameters:
Parameters like the number of trees (n_estimators) and the maximum depth of trees can be tuned for optimal performance.

Implementation:
Implemented in popular machine learning libraries like scikit-learn.
